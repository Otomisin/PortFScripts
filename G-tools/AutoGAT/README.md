# AutoGAT: Automated Geographic Area Aggregation

AutoGAT is an automated adaptation of the Geographic Aggregation Tool (GAT) that streamlines the process of combining geographic areas based on population thresholds and other numeric criteria. By transforming the interactive GAT methodology into a batch processing system, AutoGAT makes large-scale geographic data aggregation efficient and scalable.

## Core Functionality

- **Automated Aggregation**: Combines geographic areas systematically based on customizable population or case thresholds.
- **Multi-Boundary Processing**: Supports processing of multiple administrative boundaries simultaneously.
- **Intelligent Merging**: Retains GAT's advanced merging logic while automating decision-making.
- **Performance Optimization**: Features built-in geometry simplification and processing time estimation.

## Key Enhancements Over GAT

- Replaces interactive dialogs with parameter-based processing for automation.
- Introduces batch processing for large-scale geographic data aggregation.
- Includes progress tracking and detailed logging for improved transparency.
- Offers advanced analytics and performance metrics for better insights.

## Primary Applications

- Large-scale geographic aggregation projects.
- Multi-region health data analysis.
- Automated workflows for geographic data processing.
- Regular data processing pipelines for geographic and demographic studies.

## Why Choose AutoGAT?

AutoGAT combines the statistical rigor and geographic sensitivity of GAT with enhanced automation and scalability. It is the ideal tool for organizations looking to streamline their geographic aggregation workflows and handle complex, large-scale data with ease.
