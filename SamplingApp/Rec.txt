Here are several recommended improvements:

1. Data Validation and Error Handling:
- Add input validation for Excel files to check required columns before processing
- Implement better error messages for invalid data formats or missing values
- Add validation for numeric columns to ensure they contain valid numbers
- Include warnings for outliers or suspicious values in population data

2. Advanced Visualization Features:
- Add interactive maps to visualize sampling distribution using libraries like folium or plotly
- Create visual representations of the sampling stratification
- Add charts showing sample distribution across different strata
- Include a power analysis visualization

3. Sampling Methodology Enhancements:
- Add support for different sampling methods (Simple Random, Systematic, Multi-stage)
- Include options for sample size optimization based on budget constraints
- Add support for custom stratification rules
- Implement options for spatial sampling to ensure geographic representation

4. Export and Documentation:
- Add PDF report generation with sampling methodology and results
- Include option to export sampling frame with GPS coordinates
- Add metadata export with sampling parameters used
- Include sampling instructions for field teams in the exports

5. User Experience Improvements:
- Add progress bars for long calculations
- Implement undo/redo functionality for sampling parameters
- Add sample size simulator to test different parameters
- Include parameter presets for common sampling scenarios

6. Quality Control Features:
- Add statistical tests for sample representativeness
- Include diagnostics for sampling bias
- Add checks for minimum sample sizes per stratum
- Implement sample balance indicators
